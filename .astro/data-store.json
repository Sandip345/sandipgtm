A Python-based solver was developed to iteratively compute velocity triangles at the midspan by fixing the flow coefficient and loading coefficient. Free vortex radial equilibrium theory was applied to account for spanwise variations in whirl velocity. Using the specified mass flow rate, hub-to-tip ratio, and an assumed aspect ratio of 1.5, key aerodynamic parameters such as blade angles, axial velocity, degree of reaction, and rotor speed were calculated. The resulting rotor speed was approximately 11464 rpm with a tip radius of 0.2 m.\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"mt-6 mb-4\">\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"flex justify-center\">\n    \u003Cimg \n      src=\"/images/uploads/projects/compressor/vel_triangle.png\"\n      alt=\"Velocity Triangle at Rotor Midspan\"\n      class=\"w-full max-w-2xl h-auto object-contain rounded-xl shadow-md bg-white p-4\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n\n  \u003Cfigcaption class=\"mt-3 text-center text-sm text-gray-500 italic\">\n    Velocity triangles at rotor midspan used for preliminary aerodynamic design.\n  \u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n\nBlade geometry was developed by constructing circular camber lines corresponding to the calculated flow angles at the hub, mean, and tip sections.

The rotor increased the absolute velocity of the flow and imparted kinetic energy, while the stator diffused the flow and converted kinetic energy into static pressure. Spanwise analysis indicated that meridional velocity decreased toward the tip, highlighting deviations from the constant axial velocity assumption used in preliminary design. These findings emphasized the inherently three-dimensional and unsteady nature of axial compressor flow.\n\n---\n## Technical Contributions\n\nThis project demonstrates proficiency in turbomachinery aerodynamic design, velocity triangle analysis, free vortex modeling, CAD-based blade generation, structured meshing, RANS and URANS simulation, mesh independence verification, and performance evaluation under realistic engineering constraints.","src/content/projects/axial-flow-compressor-design.mdx","7662c34050f6e11d","axial-flow-compressor-design.mdx",true,"news",["Map",241,242,258,259,275,276],"visiting-research-collaborators-at-montana-state-university-1",{"id":241,"data":243,"body":211,"filePath":248,"digest":249,"rendered":250,"legacyId":257},{"title":244,"date":245,"description":246,"location":247},"Visiting Research Collaborators at Montana State University","August 3, 2025","I traveled to Montana State University to meet with our collaborators working on the near-field dynamics of vortex–surface interactions.
