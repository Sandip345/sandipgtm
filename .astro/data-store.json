Free vortex radial equilibrium theory was applied to account for spanwise variations in whirl velocity. Using the specified mass flow rate, hub-to-tip ratio, and an assumed aspect ratio of 1.5, key aerodynamic parameters such as blade angles, axial velocity, degree of reaction, and rotor speed were calculated. The resulting rotor speed was approximately 11464 rpm with a tip radius of 0.2 m.\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"mt-6 mb-4\">\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"flex justify-center\">\n    \u003Cimg \n      src=\"/images/uploads/projects/compressor/vel_triangle.png\"\n      alt=\"Velocity Triangle at Rotor Midspan\"\n      class=\"w-full max-w-2xl h-auto object-contain rounded-xl shadow-md bg-white p-4\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n\n  \u003Cfigcaption class=\"mt-3 text-center text-sm text-gray-500 italic\">\n    Fig: Velocity triangles at rotor midspan used for preliminary aerodynamic design.\n  \u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n\nBlade geometry was developed by constructing circular camber lines corresponding to the calculated flow angles at the hub, mean, and tip sections. A NACA 65-series airfoil (NACA 651212) was selected and superimposed on these camber lines to achieve an appropriate thickness distribution. The sections were stacked and smoothly blended in CATIA to generate the final three-dimensional blade geometry.\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"my-8\">\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8\">\n    \n    \u003Cdiv class=\"flex justify-center\">\n      \u003Cimg \n        src=\"/images/uploads/projects/compressor/rotor_blade.png\"\n        alt=\"Rotor Blade Geometry\"\n        class=\"w-full max-w-md h-80 object-contain rounded-xl shadow-md bg-white p-4\"\n      />\n    \u003C/div>\n\n    \u003Cdiv class=\"flex justify-center\">\n      \u003Cimg \n        src=\"/images/uploads/projects/compressor/stator_blade.png\"\n        alt=\"Stator Blade Geometry\"\n        class=\"w-full max-w-md h-80 object-contain rounded-xl shadow-md bg-white p-4\"\n      />\n    \u003C/div>\n\n  \u003C/div>\n\n  \u003Cfigcaption class=\"text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-4\">\n    Fig: Final 3D rotor and stator blade geometry generated in CATIA.\n  \u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n\n---\n## Numerical Setup\n\nStructured multi-block hexahedral meshes were generated in ANSYS TurboGrid using O–H topology to ensure adequate boundary-layer resolution. The final mesh consisted of approximately 496,000 nodes with near-wall y+ values around 20. A mesh independence study was conducted to confirm solution stability.\n\nCFD simulations were performed in ANSYS CFX using the SST k–ω turbulence model. Both steady RANS simulations with a mixing plane interface and transient URANS simulations using a time transformation model were carried out to capture rotor–stator interaction effects.\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"mt-6 mb-4\">\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"flex justify-center\">\n    \u003Cimg \n      src=\"/images/uploads/projects/compressor/mesh_topology.png\"\n      alt=\"Structured O–H Topology Mesh\"\n      class=\"w-full max-w-3xl h-auto object-contain rounded-xl shadow-md bg-white p-4\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n\n  \u003Cfigcaption class=\"mt-3 text-center text-sm text-gray-500 italic\">\n    Fig: Structured O–H topology mesh generated in ANSYS TurboGrid.\n  \u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n---\n## Results\n\nSteady-state simulations predicted a total pressure ratio of approximately 1.12 and an isentropic efficiency near 78 percent. Transient simulations revealed periodic pressure oscillations, with the pressure ratio varying between 1.13 and 1.17 due to blade row interaction. Although slightly below the target pressure ratio of 1.2, the results were achieved without geometric optimization, sweep, lean, or tip clearance modeling, demonstrating strong baseline aerodynamic performance.\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"mt-6 mb-4\">\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"flex justify-center\">\n    \u003Cimg \n      src=\"/images/uploads/projects/compressor/pressure_contour.png\"\n      alt=\"Pressure Contour\"\n      class=\"w-full max-w-3xl h-auto object-contain rounded-xl shadow-md bg-white p-4\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n\n  \u003Cfigcaption class=\"mt-3 text-center text-sm text-gray-500 italic\">\n    Fig: Pressure distribution across rotor–stator stage showing compression process.\n  \u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"mt-6 mb-4\">\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"flex justify-center\">\n    \u003Cimg \n      src=\"/images/uploads/projects/compressor/velocity_contour.png\"\n      alt=\"Velocity Contour\"\n      class=\"w-full max-w-3xl h-auto object-contain rounded-xl shadow-md bg-white p-4\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n\n  \u003Cfigcaption class=\"mt-3 text-center text-sm text-gray-500 italic\">\n    Fig: Contours of absolute and relative velocity across the stage.\n  \u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"mt-6 mb-4\">\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"flex justify-center\">\n    \u003Cimg \n      src=\"/images/uploads/projects/compressor/streamlines.png\"\n      alt=\"Streamlines\"\n      class=\"w-full max-w-3xl h-auto object-contain rounded-xl shadow-md bg-white p-4\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n\n  \u003Cfigcaption class=\"mt-3 text-center text-sm text-gray-500 italic\">\n    Fig: Secondary flow structures and passage vortex formation near endwall regions.\n  \u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n---\n## Flow Physics Observations\nFlow visualization revealed the presence of secondary flows and passage vortices, particularly near endwall regions. The rotor increased the absolute velocity of the flow and imparted kinetic energy, while the stator diffused the flow and converted kinetic energy into static pressure. Spanwise analysis indicated that meridional velocity decreased toward the tip, highlighting deviations from the constant axial velocity assumption used in preliminary design. These findings emphasized the inherently three-dimensional and unsteady nature of axial compressor flow.\n\n---\n## Technical Contributions\n\nThis project demonstrates proficiency in turbomachinery aerodynamic design, velocity triangle analysis, free vortex modeling, CAD-based blade generation, structured meshing, RANS and URANS simulation, mesh independence verification, and performance evaluation under realistic engineering constraints.","src/content/projects/axial-flow-compressor-design.mdx","933da7c52380a445","axial-flow-compressor-design.mdx","news",["Map",201,202,220,221,237,238],"visiting-research-collaborators-at-montana-state-university-1",{"id":201,"data":203,"body":208,"filePath":209,"digest":210,"rendered":211,"legacyId":219},{"title":204,"date":205,"description":206,"location":207},"Visiting Research Collaborators at Montana State University","August 3, 2025","I traveled to Montana State University to meet with our collaborators working on the near-field dynamics of vortex–surface interactions.
