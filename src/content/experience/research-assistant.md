summary: "I am currently working on an AFOSR-funded project on vortex–surface interaction, where I study the free-surface signature of a three-dimensional counter-rotating vortex pair and relate it to the subsurface dynamics, with applications in submarine stealth."

* Conduct experimental investigations of fluid systems with  repeatable test procedures, instrumentation setup, and structured data collection
* Apply flow-physics reasoning to interpret system behavior (velocity fields, pressure/free-surface response) and communicate results to a mixed technical audience
* Build analysis workflows in MATLAB/Python for processing large datasets and producing publication-quality figures
* Coordinate tasks, document progress, and present updates; emphasize QA on plots/results and traceability of assumptions
