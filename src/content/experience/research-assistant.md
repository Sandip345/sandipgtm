* Conduct experimental investigations of fluid systems with  repeatable test procedures, instrumentation setup, and structured data collection
* Apply flow-physics reasoning to interpret system behavior (velocity fields, pressure/free-surface response) and communicate results to a mixed technical audience
* Build analysis workflows in MATLAB/Python for processing large datasets and producing publication-quality figures
* Coordinate tasks, document progress, and present updates; emphasize QA on plots/results and traceability of assumptions
