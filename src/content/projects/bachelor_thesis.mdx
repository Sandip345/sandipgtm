title: Fabrication of Particle Image Velocimetry Setup at Low Reynolds Number
period: Jun 2022 – Mar 2023
description: In this project, we designed and fabricated a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) setup to study low Reynolds number flow over a flat plate (chord length 76.33 mm) in the range of Re = 2,000–10,000. The system utilized a Class IIIB laser for particle illumination, a Chronos 2.1 high-speed camera, and a smartphone camera for PIV and flow visualization. Velocity fields were obtained through cross-correlation of sequential images using PIVlab (MATLAB). The experimental data were analyzed to identify key flow features such as laminar separation bubbles, reattachment points, turbulent mixing, and trailing-edge vortex shedding. Results were further validated through CFD simulations conducted under similar conditions, and potential sources of experimental and processing errors were systematically evaluated.

## Engineering Design and Structural Validation

The facility consists of a 2 m recirculating glass tank, a rigid structural frame, and a gantry-driven flat plate actuation mechanism. Blockage ratio constraints were 
imposed to maintain aerodynamic fidelity below 5%, ensuring minimal wall interference on flow development. Structural integrity of the tank under hydrostatic loading 
was verified using finite element analysis, leading to a 10 mm glass thickness selection with a safety factor of approximately 15.
The actuation system was powered by a bipolar stepper motor controlled via ESP8266 and L298N driver circuitry, enabling precise velocity control and repeatable Reynolds 
number targeting. This ensured dynamic similarity and controlled transient flow initiation.

## Optical System and Flow Seeding Strategy

Planar laser illumination was generated using a Class IIIB 5 mW laser to produce a thin light sheet intersecting the measurement plane. 
Flow tracing was achieved using fine glass powder particles (less than 190 µm), selected after evaluating relaxation time and sedimentation velocity 
to ensure adequate flow-following capability under low-speed conditions.
High-speed image acquisition was performed using a Chronos 2.1 camera (100 fps), while additional frame extraction was performed using a secondary 
imaging system for lower frame rate validation.

## Image Processing and Velocity Reconstruction
Velocity fields were reconstructed using PIVlab (MATLAB-based FFT cross-correlation). Pre-processing included Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram 
Equalization (CLAHE), high-pass filtering, and intensity normalization to enhance particle visibility and minimize noise contamination. Vector validation and spurious 
vector removal were applied to ensure reliable cross-correlation peak detection. The processing pipeline enabled accurate recovery of instantaneous velocity vectors and 
vorticity contours, even under low particle density conditions.

## Experimental Investigation and Flow Physics

Two test configurations were investigated: a NACA 0012 airfoil (Re ≈ 3,270) and a flat plate (Re ≈ 6,040). The velocity vector fields revealed leading-edge vortex formation 
and laminar separation bubble behavior consistent with low Reynolds number aerodynamic theory. Vorticity contours showed coherent vortex shedding patterns downstream of the flat plate, 
indicating successful resolution of unsteady flow structures.
Spanwise velocity variations and near-wall flow distortion highlighted three-dimensional effects and the limitations of quasi-two-dimensional assumptions. Experimental results were 
compared against ANSYS Fluent simulations to assess qualitative agreement in separation location and velocity distribution trends.

## Uncertainty and Error Analysis
Measurement uncertainty was assessed based on particle size, interrogation window size, image resolution, and cross-correlation sensitivity. Primary error sources included illumination 
non-uniformity, particle sedimentation, optical distortion, and low signal-to-noise ratio at high displacement gradients. Despite these limitations, velocity trends remained consistent 
with theoretical and numerical predictions.
