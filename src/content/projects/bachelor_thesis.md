title: Fabrication of Particle Image Velocimetry Setup at Low Reynolds Number
period: Jun 2022 – Mar 2023
description: In this project, we designed and fabricated a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) setup to study low Reynolds number flow over a flat plate (chord length 76.33 mm) in the range of Re = 2,000–10,000. The system utilized a Class IIIB laser for particle illumination, a Chronos 2.1 high-speed camera, and a smartphone camera for PIV and flow visualization. Velocity fields were obtained through cross-correlation of sequential images using PIVlab (MATLAB). The experimental data were analyzed to identify key flow features such as laminar separation bubbles, reattachment points, turbulent mixing, and trailing-edge vortex shedding. Results were further validated through CFD simulations conducted under similar conditions, and potential sources of experimental and processing errors were systematically evaluated.
