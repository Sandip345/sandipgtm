title: Thermal Vacuum Chamber Design
period: "2022"
description: We constructed a quadcopter using an Arduino Uno microcontroller and off-the-shelf components for demonstration at MechTRIX-X. We implemented PID control algorithms for roll and pitch stabilization and systematically tuned the control parameters to achieve a stable hover. The quadcopter was successfully demonstrated at MechTRIX-X, showcasing the integration of embedded programming, control theory, and mechanical design principles.

## Thermal Vacuum Chamber (TVC) Design

As part of capacity-building efforts for satellite testing infrastructure in Nepal, I contributed to the preliminary design of a **Thermal Vacuum Chamber (TVC)** intended for environmental qualification testing of CubeSats up to 6U configuration.

A thermal vacuum chamber replicates the extreme vacuum and thermal conditions encountered in low Earth orbit. The objective of this project was to design a structurally sound, thermally capable, and economically feasible chamber suitable for small satellite validation within Nepal.

---

## Project Objective

The primary goal was to develop a compact TVC capable of performing:

- Thermal Vacuum Test (TVT)
- Thermal Cycling Test
- Thermal Balance Test

The system was designed to simulate:

- Internal pressure: ~10⁻⁴ torr
- Temperature range: −100°F to 220°F
- External atmospheric pressure loading under vacuum conditions

---

## System Architecture

The TVC was subdivided into three major subsystems:

1. External Pressure Vessel
2. Heating and Cooling System (Cryoshroud)
3. Vacuum System

---

## External Pressure Vessel Design

The chamber was designed as a cylindrical pressure vessel subjected to **external atmospheric pressure**, following ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (Section VIII).

**Design Specifications:**

- Length: 900 mm  
- Diameter: 900 mm  
- Material: 304 Stainless Steel  
- Modulus of Elasticity: 193 GPa  
- Compressive Strength: 205–310 MPa  

Thickness calculations were performed iteratively under three configurations:

- Without reinforcement  
- With one reinforcement  
- With two reinforcements  

A thickness of **2 mm** was determined to safely withstand the design pressure.

## Head Selection and Structural Validation

Three head configurations were analyzed:

- Flat head
- Spherical head
- Tori-spherical head

Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was conducted in ANSYS Mechanical.

Results showed:

- Flat and spherical heads failed at shell intersection
- Tori-spherical head exhibited maximum Von Mises stress of 143.98 MPa
- Maximum deformation: 0.448 mm
- Full assembly deformation (with cutouts): 0.536 mm

The tori-spherical head was selected due to its superior structural integrity under external pressure loading.

## Heating and Cooling System (Cryoshroud Design)

To simulate orbital thermal conditions, an internal cryoshroud system was developed.

### Heating System

- Conductive heating selected for simplicity
- Three 475 W strip heaters (240V)
- Copper platen for uniform heat distribution
- K-type thermocouples for feedback control

A closed-loop temperature control strategy was proposed for automated regulation.

### Cooling System

Radiative cooling was implemented using liquid nitrogen circulation.

Two design concepts were evaluated:

- Helical pipe configuration
- Multi-circular loop configuration

The circular pipe design was selected for ease of manufacturability and integration.

Final Cryoshroud Parameters:

- Radius: 350 mm  
- Length: 850 mm  
- Aluminum alloy thermal shroud

## Thermal Analysis

Steady-state thermal analysis was conducted in ANSYS.

Modeling included:

- Conductive heat transfer (heater to satellite)
- Radiative cooling (shroud to satellite)
- Thermal emission between components

Simulation results demonstrated achievable surface temperatures up to 46°C on the satellite model, validating heating system feasibility.

## Vacuum System Design

The vacuum system was designed to achieve required low-pressure conditions using:

- Roughing pump
- Turbo pump
- Vacuum gauges
- Isolation valves
- Residual Gas Analyzer (RGA)

---

## Engineering Contributions

This project demonstrates:

- Pressure vessel design under external loading (ASME methodology)
- Head configuration comparison and FEA validation
- Integrated thermal system design (heating + LN2 cooling)
- Cryoshroud structural and thermal modeling
- Vacuum system architecture planning
- CAD modeling in CATIA
- Structural and thermal simulation in ANSYS

The proposed TVC design represents an important step toward establishing indigenous satellite environmental testing capability within Nepal.
