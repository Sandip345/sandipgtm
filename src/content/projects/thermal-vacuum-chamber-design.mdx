title: Thermal Vacuum Chamber Design
period: "2022"
description: We constructed a quadcopter using an Arduino Uno microcontroller and off-the-shelf components for demonstration at MechTRIX-X. We implemented PID control algorithms for roll and pitch stabilization and systematically tuned the control parameters to achieve a stable hover. The quadcopter was successfully demonstrated at MechTRIX-X, showcasing the integration of embedded programming, control theory, and mechanical design principles.
