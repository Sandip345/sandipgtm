title: Lift & Drag Data Acquisition
period: Jan 2021 – Feb 2021
description: We designed and built an experimental setup using a load cell, LabVIEW, and NI DAQmx to acquire lift and drag data for a NACA 0012 airfoil. We integrated the control and data acquisition hardware to capture force measurements synchronized with flow conditions. The experimental results were validated through CFD simulations in Ansys, where we compared lift and drag coefficients across a range of angles of attack and identified potential sources of experimental error.
