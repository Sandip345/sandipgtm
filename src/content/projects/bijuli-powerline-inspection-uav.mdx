title: Bijuli – Powerline Inspection Fixed Wing Battery Powered UAV
period: Jun 2022 – Jan 2023
description: This project involved the conceptual design, aerodynamic analysis, and performance evaluation of a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) intended for power line inspection in challenging terrain and weather conditions. The aircraft, named Bijuli, was designed to operate in the mountainous environment of Nepal, where long endurance, stable low-speed flight, and reliable imaging capability are critical. The primary objective was to develop a cost-effective battery-powered UAV capable of covering a 50–60 km inspection corridor while maintaining aerodynamic stability, efficient cruise performance, and short takeoff and landing capability.

## Design Requirements and Mission Constraints
The aircraft was designed under the following constraints:
* Maximum takeoff weight: 8 kg
* Cruise speed: 18 m/s
* Range: 50–60 km
* Cruise altitude: 400 m
* Electric propulsion system
* Short-field takeoff and landing capability
* Maximum camera field of view during cruise
The mission profile required sustained straight-and-level flight over transmission corridors, with stable imaging and low stall speed to ensure safe maneuvering near infrastructure.

## Aerodynamic Configuration and Geometry
The UAV features a high-wing configuration for enhanced lateral stability and ground clearance. The wing design includes:
* Wingspan: 2.8 m
* Aspect ratio: 10
* Root chord: 0.28 m
* Tip chord: 0.28 m
* Zero sweep angle
* MAC: 0.14 m
The high aspect ratio improves lift-to-drag ratio, enhancing cruise efficiency and endurance. Zero sweep was selected to simplify construction and maintain predictable stall characteristics.

## Longitudinal Stability and Neutral Point Determination

Static longitudinal stability was evaluated through trim curve analysis and neutral point estimation. The neutral point was determined both experimentally and via XFLR/X-Plane simulation methods. The trim versus lift coefficient curves allowed estimation of aerodynamic center location and stability margin.

The aircraft demonstrated positive static stability with acceptable static margin for safe autonomous flight operations.

## Performance Analysis
Performance metrics were evaluated under steady and climb/descent conditions.
### Cruise Performance
* Cruise speed: 18 m/s
* Lift-to-drag optimized for endurance

### Climb and Descent
Sawtooth climb and descent maneuvers were analyzed to evaluate rate of climb and sink rate behavior.

### Stall Characteristics
Stall speed was estimated at approximately 3.23 m/s, ensuring safe low-speed operation during inspection passes.

## Dynamic Stability and Handling (Cooper-Harper Evaluation)

Handling qualities were assessed using Cooper-Harper criteria to evaluate pilot workload and controllability. The aircraft demonstrated acceptable handling qualities for semi-autonomous inspection operations.
