title: Finite Element Heat Conduction
period: Mar 2022 – Apr 2022
description: In this project, we enhanced an existing MATLAB code for two-dimensional heat conduction based on the finite element method by adding functionality to incorporate internal heat sources. We also implemented routines to compute both the temperature distribution and the corresponding heat flux throughout the domain. These modifications improved numerical stability and introduced enhanced visualization outputs, making the tool more comprehensive and versatile for advanced thermal analysis applications.
