title: Bijuli – Powerline Inspection Fixed Wing Battery Powered UAV
period: Jun 2022 – Jan 2023
description: In this project, we designed a fixed-wing, battery-powered UAV for power line inspection in Nepal. The project involved preliminary aerodynamic sizing, stability and control analysis, structural considerations, and detailed mission planning. We developed Python scripts to evaluate aerodynamic performance across various flight envelopes, enabling systematic assessment of efficiency and operational feasibility. The work culminated in a comprehensive poster presentation that highlighted the UAV’s technical capabilities and its potential impact on improving the safety, efficiency, and reliability of power line maintenance in remote regions.
