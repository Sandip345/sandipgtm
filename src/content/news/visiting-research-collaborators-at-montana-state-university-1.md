title: Visiting Research Collaborators at Montana State University
description: I traveled to Montana State University to meet with our collaborators working on the near-field dynamics of vortex–surface interactions. During the visit, I learned about the flow visualization techniques they employ and observed their PIV setup to support the development of a similar system at UNH. The experience provided a valuable opportunity to learn from experts in the field and strengthen our collaborative research efforts.
