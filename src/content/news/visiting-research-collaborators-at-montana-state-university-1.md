title: Visiting Research Collaborators at Montana State University
description: I traveled to Montana State University to meet with our collaborators working on the near-field dynamics of vortex–surface interactions. During the visit, I learned about the flow visualization techniques they employ and observed their PIV setup to support the development of a similar system at UNH. The experience provided a valuable opportunity to learn from experts in the field and strengthen our collaborative research efforts.

During the visit, I gained hands-on experience with dye-based flow visualization techniques to examine counter-rotating vortex structures. Additionally, I conducted quantitative analyses using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements to characterize the associated CR vortex pairs.
